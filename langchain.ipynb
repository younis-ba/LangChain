To identify individual fall risk, it is important to understand the complex interplay of fall-related factors. Although fall events are common, they are seldom observed, and fall reports are often biased. Due to the rapid development of wearable inertial sensors, an objective approach to capture fall events and the corresponding circumstances is provided. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to operationalize a prototypical dynamic fall risk model regarding 4 ecologically valid real-world scenarios (opening a door, slipping, tripping, and usage of public transportation). We hypothesize that individual fall risk is associated with an interplay of intrinsic risk factors, activity, and environmental factors that can be estimated by using data measured within a laboratory simulation setting. METHODS: We will recruit 30 community-dwelling people aged 60 years or older. To identify several fall-related intrinsic fall risk factors, appropriate clinical assessments will be selected. The experimental setup is adaptable so that the level of fall risk for each activity and each environmental factor is adjustable. By different levels of difficulty, the effect on the risk of falling will be investigated. An 8-camera motion tracking system will be used to record absolute body motions and limits of stability. All laboratory experiments will also be recorded by inertial sensors (L5, dominant leg) and video camera. Logistic regression analyses will be used to model the association between risk factors and falls. Continuous fall risk will be modeled by generalized linear regression models using margin of stability as outcome parameter. RESULTS: The results of this project will prove the concept and establish methods to further use the dynamic fall risk model. Recruitment and measurement initially began in October 2020 but were halted because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment and measurements recommenced in October 2022, and by February 2023, a total of 25 of the planned 30 subjects have been measured. CONCLUSIONS: In the field of fall prevention, a more precise fall risk model will have a significant impact on research leading to more effective prevention approaches. Given the described burden related to falls and the high prevalence, considerable improvements in fall prevention will have a significant impact on individual quality of life and also on society in general by reducing institutionalization and health care costs. The setup will enable the analysis of fall events and their circumstances ecologically valid in a laboratory setting and thereby will provide important information to estimate the individual instantaneous fall risk.

Even though WTD are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is no evidence of infection by this virus in other mammalian species that might interact with WTD in nature. Similar to WTD, feral swine are widely distributed and generally occupy the same range as WTD in Texas. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in WTD during 2020 and 2021 and determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in feral swine during 2018 (prepandemic period) and from March 2020 to February 2021 (pandemic period) in Travis County, Texas. Materials and Methods: Sera samples were collected from hunter-killed WTD and feral swine during the prepandemic and pandemic period and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody by a plaque reduction neutralization assay in Vero cells. Results: SARS-CoV-2 antibody was not detected in any of the 166 feral swine sera samples, including 24 samples collected during the prepandemic and 142 samples collected during the pandemic period. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 antibody was not detected in the 115 WTD samples collected during late 2020, but antibody was detected in WTD in early 2021. Conclusions: The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of WTD occurred during early 2021 in Travis County, Texas, but serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not detected in the feral swine samples collected from the same locality and during the same time period of the collection of WTD samples.',\n","  'FAU': ['Palermo, Pedro M',\n","   'Orbegozo, Jeanette',\n","   'Watts, Douglas M',\n","   'Morrill, John C'],\n","  'AU': ['Palermo PM', 'Orbegozo J', 'Watts DM', 'Morrill JC'],\n","  'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-7471-0801'],\n","  'AD': ['Department of Biological Science and Border Biomedical Research Center, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, USA.',\n","   'Department of Biological Science and Border Biomedical Research Center, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, USA.',\n","   'Department of Biological Science and Border Biomedical Research Center, University of Texas at El Paso, El Paso, Texas, USA.',\n","   'Orion Research and Management Services, Gatesville, Texas, USA.'],\n","  'LA': ['eng'],\n","  'PT': ['Journal Article'],\n","  'DEP': '20230510',\n","  'PL': 'United States',\n","  'TA': 'Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis',\n","  'JT': 'Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)',\n","  'JID': '100965525',\n","  'SB': 'IM',\n","  'OTO': ['NOTNLM'],\n","  'OT': ['SARS-CoV-2',\n","   'Texas',\n","   'feral swine',\n","   'neutralizing antibody',\n","   'white-tailed deer'],\n","  'EDAT': '2023/05/10 12:42',\n","  'MHDA': '2023/05/10 12:42',\n","  'CRDT': ['2023/05/10 11:35'],\n","  'PHST': ['2023/05/10 12:42 [medline]',\n","   '2023/05/10 12:42 [pubmed]',\n","   '2023/05/10 11:35 [entrez]'],\n","  'AID': ['10.1089/vbz.2023.0006 [doi]'],\n","  'PST': 'aheadofprint',\n","  'SO': 'Vector Borne Zoonotic Dis. 2023 May 10. doi: 10.1089/vbz.2023.0006.'},\n"," {'PMID': '37163264',\n","  'OWN': 'NLM',\n","  'STAT': 'Publisher',\n","  'LR': '20230510',\n","  'IS': '2574-3805 (Electronic) 2574-3805 (Linking)',\n","  'VI': '6',\n","  'IP': '5',\n","  'DP': '2023 May 1',\n","  'TI': \"Investigating Social Media to Evaluate Emergency Medicine Physicians' Emotional Well-being During COVID-19.\",\n","  'PG': 'e2312708',\n","  'LID': '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.12708 [doi]',\n","  'AB': 'IMPORTANCE: Emergency medicine (EM) physicians experience tremendous emotional health strain, which has been exacerbated during COVID-19, and many have taken to social media to express themselves. OBJECTIVE: To analyze social media content from academic EM physicians and resident physicians to investigate changes in content and language as indicators of their emotional well-being. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used machine learning and natural language processing of Twitter posts from self-described academic EM physicians and resident physicians between March 2018 and March 2022. Participants included academic EM physicians and resident physicians with publicly accessible posts (at least 300 total words across the posts) from the US counties with the top 10 COVID-19 case burdens. Data analysis was performed from June to September 2022. EXPOSURE: Being an EM physician or resident physician who posted on Twitter. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Social media content themes during the prepandemic period, during the pandemic, and across the phases of the pandemic were analyzed. Psychological constructs evaluated included anxiety, anger, depression, and loneliness. Positive and negative language sentiment within posts was measured. RESULTS: This study identified 471 physicians with a total of 198\\u202f867 posts (mean [SD], 11\\u202f403 [18\\u202f998] words across posts; median [IQR], 3445 [1100-11\\u202f591] words across posts). The top 5 prepandemic themes included free open-access medical education (Cohen d, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.38-0.50), residency education (Cohen d, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.37-0.49), gun violence (Cohen d, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.32-0.44), quality improvement in health care (Cohen d, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.27-0.39), and professional resident associations (Cohen d, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.27-0.39). During the pandemic, themes were significantly related to healthy behaviors during COVID-19 (Cohen d, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.90), pandemic response (Cohen d, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.77), vaccines and vaccination (Cohen d, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53-0.66), unstable housing and homelessness (Cohen d, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34-0.47), and emotional support for others (Cohen d, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34-0.46). Across the phases of the pandemic, thematic content within social media posts changed significantly. Compared with the prepandemic period, there was significantly less positive, and concordantly more negative, language used during COVID-19. Estimates of loneliness, anxiety, anger, and depression also increased significantly during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, key thematic shifts and increases in language related to anxiety, anger, depression, and loneliness were identified in the content posted on social media by academic EM physicians and resident physicians during the pandemic. Social media may provide a real-time and evolving landscape to evaluate thematic content and linguistics related to emotions and sentiment for health care workers.',\n","  'FAU': ['Agarwal, Anish K',\n","   'Mittal, Juhi',\n","   'Tran, Annie',\n","   'Merchant, Raina',\n","   'Guntuku, Sharath Chandra'],\n","  'AU': ['Agarwal AK', 'Mittal J', 'Tran A', 'Merchant R', 'Guntuku SC'],\n","  'AD': ['Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.',\n","   'Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.',\n","   'Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Penn Medicine Center for Digital Health, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.',\n","   'Computer and Information Science, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.',\n","   'Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.'],\n","  'LA': ['eng'],\n","  'PT': ['Journal Article'],\n","  'DEP': '20230501',\n","  'PL': 'United States',\n","  'TA': 'JAMA Netw Open',\n","  'JT': 'JAMA network open',\n","  'JID': '101729235',\n","  'SB': 'IM',\n","  'EDAT': '2023/05/10 12:42',\n","  'MHDA': '2023/05/10 12:42',\n","  'CRDT': ['2023/05/10 11:34'],\n","  'PHST': ['2023/05/10 12:42 [medline]',\n","   '2023/05/10 12:42 [pubmed]',\n","   '2023/05/10 11:34 [entrez]'],\n","  'AID': ['2804673 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.12708 [doi]'],\n","  'PST': 'epublish',\n","  'SO': 'JAMA Netw Open. 2023 May 1;6(5):e2312708. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.12708.'},\n"," {'PMID': '37163224',\n","  'OWN': 'NLM',\n","  'STAT': 'Publisher',\n","  'LR': '20230510',\n","  'IS': '2211-5463 (Electronic) 2211-5463 (Linking)',\n","  'DP': '2023 May 10',\n","  'TI': 'Current trends in RNA virus detection through metatranscriptome sequencing data.',\n","  'LID': '10.1002/2211-5463.13626 [doi]',\n","  'AB': 'With advances in sequencing technology, metatranscriptome sequencing from a variety of environmental and biological sources has revealed the existence of various previously unknown RNA viruses.

Since surgical patients also require ICU admission, determining which factors lead to an increased risk of postoperative ICU admission is essential. This study aims to determine which factors led to an increased risk of unplanned postoperative ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This multicentre retrospective cohort study investigated all patients who underwent surgery between 9 March 2020 and 30 June 2020. The primary endpoint was the number of surgical patients requiring postoperative ICU admission. The secondary endpoint was to determine factors leading to an increased risk of unplanned postoperative ICU admission, calculated by multivariate analysis with odds ratios (OR's) and 95% confidence (CI) intervals. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five (4.6%) of the 4051 included patients required unplanned postoperative ICU admission. COVID-19 positive patients were at an increased risk of being admitted to the ICU compared to COVID-19 negative (OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.06-9.33; p = 0.040) and untested patients (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.32-0.70; p = 0.001). Other predictors were male gender (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.02-1.82; p = 0.046), body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.08; p = 0.001), surgical urgency and surgical discipline. CONCLUSION: A confirmed COVID-19 infection, male gender, elevated BMI, surgical urgency, and surgical discipline were independent factors for an increased risk of unplanned postoperative ICU admission. In the event of similar pandemics, postponing surgery in patients with an increased risk of postoperative ICU admission may be considered.\",\n","  'CI': ['(c) 2023 The Author(s).'],\n","  'FAU': ['de Bock, Ellen',\n","   'Filipe, Mando D',\n","   'Herman, Eline S',\n","   'Pronk, Apollo',\n","   'Boerma, Djamila',\n","   'Heikens, Joost T',\n","   'Verheijen, Paul M',\n","   'Vriens, Menno R',\n","   'Richir, Milan C'],\n","  'AU': ['de Bock E',\n","   'Filipe MD',\n","   'Herman ES',\n","   'Pronk A',\n","   'Boerma D',\n","   'Heikens JT',\n","   'Verheijen PM',\n","   'Vriens MR',\n","   'Richir MC'],\n","  'AD': ['Department of Surgery, Cancer Centre, University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, Cancer Centre, University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, Diakonessenhuis, Utrecht, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, Diakonessenhuis, Utrecht, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, St. Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, Rivierenland Hospital, Tiel, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, Meander Medical Centre, Amersfoort, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, Cancer Centre, University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands.',\n","   'Department of Surgery, Cancer Centre, University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands.'],\n","  'LA': ['eng'],\n","  'PT': ['Journal Article'],\n","  'DEP': '20230505',\n","  'PL': 'England',\n","  'TA': 'Int J Surg Open',\n","  'JT': 'International journal of surgery open',\n","  'JID': '101729980',\n","  'PMC': 'PMC10159662',\n","  'OTO': ['NOTNLM'],\n","  'OT': ['COVID-19',\n","   'Coronavirus',\n","   'Intensive care units',\n","   'Postoperative care',\n","   'SARS-CoV-2'],\n","  'COIS': ['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.'],\n","  'EDAT': '2023/05/10 12:42',\n","  'MHDA': '2023/05/10 12:42',\n","  'CRDT': ['2023/05/10 11:25'],\n","  'PHST': ['2023/05/10 12:42 [medline]',\n","   '2023/05/10 12:42 [pubmed]',\n","   '2022/09/19 00:00 [received]',\n","   '2023/04/12 00:00 [revised]',\n","   '2023/04/30 00:00 [accepted]',\n","   '2023/05/10 11:25 [entrez]'],\n","  'AID': ['S2405-8572(23)00033-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijso.2023.100620 [doi]'],\n","  'PST': 'ppublish',\n","  'SO': 'Int J Surg Open. 2023 Jun;55:100620. doi: 10.1016/j.ijso.2023.100620.

To this end, we analyse political speeches by various Norwegian ministers to elucidate how various model-based COVID-19 responses enact a 'model citizen'. Theoretically, we combine Rhodes et al.'s arguments with Foucault's concepts of law, discipline and security, thus showing what a model society might imply for the model citizen.

Both the HbA1c home kit and GMI showed a slight positive bias (mean difference 0.18% and 0.34%, respectively) and strong concordance with POC HbA1c (rho(c) = 0.982 [0.965, 0.991] and 0.823 [0.686, 0.904], respectively). GMI showed a slight positive bias (mean difference 0.28%) and fair concordance (rho(c) = 0.750 [0.658, 0.820]) to the HbA1c home kit. In conclusion, the strong concordance of GMI and home kits to POC A1c measures suggest their utility in telehealth visits assessments. Although these are not candidates for replacement, these measures can facilitate telehealth visits, particularly in the context of other POC HbA1c measurements from an individual.\",\n","  'FAU': ['Zaharieva, Dessi P',\n","   'Addala, Ananta',\n","   'Prahalad, Priya',\n","   'Leverenz, Brianna',\n","   'Arrizon-Ruiz, Nora',\n","   'Ding, Victoria Y',\n","   'Desai, Manisha',\n","   'Karger, Amy B',\n","   'Maahs, David M'],\n","  'AU': ['Zaharieva DP',\n","   'Addala A',\n","   'Prahalad P',\n","   'Leverenz B',\n","   'Arrizon-Ruiz N',\n","   'Ding VY',\n","   'Desai M',\n","   'Karger AB',\n","   'Maahs DM'],\n","  'AD': ['Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.',\n","   'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.',\n","   'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.',\n","   'Stanford Diabetes Research Center, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.',\n","   'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.',\n","   'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.',\n","   'Quantitative Sciences Unit, Division of Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.',\n","   'Quantitative Sciences Unit, Division of Biomedical Informatics Research, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.',\n","   'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.',\n","   'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.',\n","   'Stanford Diabetes Research Center, Stanford, CA 94304, USA.'],\n","  'AUID': ['ORCID: 0000-0002-0508-4309', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6949-2651'],\n","  'LA': ['eng'],\n","  'PT': ['Journal Article'],\n","  'DEP': '20220913',\n","  'PL': 'Switzerland',\n","  'TA': 'Diabetology (Basel)',\n","  'JT': 'Diabetology',\n","  'JID': '9918591786806676',\n","  'PMC': 'PMC10166120',\n","  'OTO': ['NOTNLM'],\n","  'OT': ['HbA1c',\n","   'continuous glucose monitoring',\n","   'pediatrics',\n","   'telemedicine',\n","   'type 1 diabetes'],\n","  'COIS': [\"Conflicts of Interest: D.P.Z. has received speaker's honoraria from Medtronic\",\n","   'Diabetes, Ascensia Diabetes, and Insulet Canada; and research support from the',\n","   'Helmsley Charitable Trust and ISPAD-JDRF Research Fellowship.

To identify individual fall risk, it is important to understand the complex interplay of fall-related factors. Although fall events are common, they are seldom observed, and fall reports are often biased. Due to the rapid development of wearable inertial sensors, an objective approach to capture fall events and the corresponding circumstances is provided. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work is to operationalize a prototypical dynamic fall risk model regarding 4 ecologically valid real-world scenarios (opening a door, slipping, tripping, and usage of public transportation). We hypothesize that individual fall risk is associated with an interplay of intrinsic risk factors, activity, and environmental factors that can be estimated by using data measured within a laboratory simulation setting. METHODS: We will recruit 30 community-dwelling people aged 60 years or older. To identify several fall-related intrinsic fall risk factors, appropriate clinical assessments will be selected. The experimental setup is adaptable so that the level of fall risk for each activity and each environmental factor is adjustable. By different levels of difficulty, the effect on the risk of falling will be investigated. An 8-camera motion tracking system will be used to record absolute body motions and limits of stability. All laboratory experiments will also be recorded by inertial sensors (L5, dominant leg) and video camera. Logistic regression analyses will be used to model the association between risk factors and falls. Continuous fall risk will be modeled by generalized linear regression models using margin of stability as outcome parameter. RESULTS: The results of this project will prove the concept and establish methods to further use the dynamic fall risk model. Recruitment and measurement initially began in October 2020 but were halted because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recruitment and measurements recommenced in October 2022, and by February 2023, a total of 25 of the planned 30 subjects have been measured. CONCLUSIONS: In the field of fall prevention, a more precise fall risk model will have a significant impact on research leading to more effective prevention approaches. Given the described burden related to falls and the high prevalence, considerable improvements in fall prevention will have a significant impact on individual quality of life and also on society in general by reducing institutionalization and health care costs. The setup will enable the analysis of fall events and their circumstances ecologically valid in a laboratory setting and thereby will provide important information to estimate the individual instantaneous fall risk.

Even though WTD are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is no evidence of infection by this virus in other mammalian species that might interact with WTD in nature. Similar to WTD, feral swine are widely distributed and generally occupy the same range as WTD in Texas. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in WTD during 2020 and 2021 and determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody in feral swine during 2018 (prepandemic period) and from March 2020 to February 2021 (pandemic period) in Travis County, Texas. Materials and Methods: Sera samples were collected from hunter-killed WTD and feral swine during the prepandemic and pandemic period and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibody by a plaque reduction neutralization assay in Vero cells. Results: SARS-CoV-2 antibody was not detected in any of the 166 feral swine sera samples, including 24 samples collected during the prepandemic and 142 samples collected during the pandemic period. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 antibody was not detected in the 115 WTD samples collected during late 2020, but antibody was detected in WTD in early 2021. Conclusions: The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2 infection of WTD occurred during early 2021 in Travis County, Texas, but serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was not detected in the feral swine samples collected from the same locality and during the same time period of the collection of WTD samples.\n","Content: ['Palermo, Pedro M', 'Orbegozo, Jeanette', 'Watts, Douglas M', 'Morrill, John C']\n","\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: Investigating Social Media to Evaluate Emergency Medicine Physicians' Emotional Well-being During COVID-19.\n","Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Emergency medicine (EM) physicians experience tremendous emotional health strain, which has been exacerbated during COVID-19, and many have taken to social media to express themselves. OBJECTIVE: To analyze social media content from academic EM physicians and resident physicians to investigate changes in content and language as indicators of their emotional well-being. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used machine learning and natural language processing of Twitter posts from self-described academic EM physicians and resident physicians between March 2018 and March 2022. Participants included academic EM physicians and resident physicians with publicly accessible posts (at least 300 total words across the posts) from the US counties with the top 10 COVID-19 case burdens. Data analysis was performed from June to September 2022. EXPOSURE: Being an EM physician or resident physician who posted on Twitter. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Social media content themes during the prepandemic period, during the pandemic, and across the phases of the pandemic were analyzed. Psychological constructs evaluated included anxiety, anger, depression, and loneliness. Positive and negative language sentiment within posts was measured. RESULTS: This study identified 471 physicians with a total of 198 867 posts (mean [SD], 11 403 [18 998] words across posts; median [IQR], 3445 [1100-11 591] words across posts). The top 5 prepandemic themes included free open-access medical education (Cohen d, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.38-0.50), residency education (Cohen d, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.37-0.49), gun violence (Cohen d, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.32-0.44), quality improvement in health care (Cohen d, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.27-0.39), and professional resident associations (Cohen d, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.27-0.39). During the pandemic, themes were significantly related to healthy behaviors during COVID-19 (Cohen d, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.90), pandemic response (Cohen d, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.65-0.77), vaccines and vaccination (Cohen d, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.53-0.66), unstable housing and homelessness (Cohen d, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34-0.47), and emotional support for others (Cohen d, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.34-0.46). Across the phases of the pandemic, thematic content within social media posts changed significantly. Compared with the prepandemic period, there was significantly less positive, and concordantly more negative, language used during COVID-19. Estimates of loneliness, anxiety, anger, and depression also increased significantly during COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, key thematic shifts and increases in language related to anxiety, anger, depression, and loneliness were identified in the content posted on social media by academic EM physicians and resident physicians during the pandemic. Social media may provide a real-time and evolving landscape to evaluate thematic content and linguistics related to emotions and sentiment for health care workers.\n","Content: ['Agarwal, Anish K', 'Mittal, Juhi', 'Tran, Annie', 'Merchant, Raina', 'Guntuku, Sharath Chandra']\n","\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: Current trends in RNA virus detection through metatranscriptome sequencing data.\n","Abstract: With advances in sequencing technology, metatranscriptome sequencing from a variety of environmental and biological sources has revealed the existence of various previously unknown RNA viruses.

COVID-19 cumulative incidence (cases per 1,000 persons) for each U.S. correctional or detention facility and people ages 18 years and older in the associated county was estimated between January 1, 2020 and July 20, 2021. Across 46 U.S. states, 1,083 correctional or detention facilities in 718 counties were included. The median COVID-19 incidence rate was higher in facilities than in associated counties for 42 of 46 states and for all facility jurisdictions and county urbanicity categories. COVID-19 burden was higher in most facilities than in associated counties. Implementing COVID-19 mitigation measures in correctional settings is needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in facilities and associated counties.\n","Content: ['Hershow, Rebecca B', 'Burnett, Janet C', 'Nicolae, Lavinia', 'Marquez, Neal', 'Everett, Michael', 'Tyagi, Erika', 'Williams, Samantha P']\n","\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: Enantioselective Effect of Chiral Small Molecules in SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine-Induced Immune Response.\n","Abstract: Although numerous chiral small molecules have been discovered and synthesized, the investigation on their enantioselective immunological effects remains limited. In this study, we designed and synthesized a pair of small molecule enantiomers (R/S-ResP) by covalently bonding two immunostimulators (resiquimod/Res) onto a planar chiral framework (paracyclophane/P). Notably, we found that S-ResP exhibits a 4.05-fold higher affinity for toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) than R-ResP, thereby more effectively enhancing the functions of dendritic cells and macrophages in cytokine secretion and antigen internalization. Furthermore, we observed that S-ResP significantly enhances RBD antigen-induced cross-neutralization against various SARS-CoV-2 strains compared to R-ResP. These findings demonstrate the enantioselective effects of small molecules on regulating vaccine-induced immune responses and emphasize the significance of chirality in designing small molecular adjuvants.\n","Content: ['Zhou, Zhengmiao', 'Zhang, Yufang', 'Ji, Honghan', 'Jin, Yu', 'Chen, Sisi', 'Duan, Pengfei', 'Liu, Ye']\n","\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: Randomized clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines: Do adenovirus-vector vaccines have beneficial non-specific effects?\n","Abstract: We examined the possible non-specific effects of novel mRNA- and adenovirus-vector COVID-19 vaccines by reviewing the randomized control trials (RCTs) of mRNA and adenovirus-vector COVID-19 vaccines. We calculated mortality risk ratios (RRs) for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines vs. placebo recipients and compared them with the RR for adenovirus-vector COVID-19 vaccine recipients vs. controls. The RR for overall mortality of mRNA vaccines vs. placebo was 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63-1.71). In the adenovirus-vector vaccine RCTs, the RR for overall mortality was 0.37 (0.19-0.70). The two vaccine types differed significantly with respect to impact on overall mortality (p = 0.015). The RCTs of COVID-19 vaccines were unblinded rapidly, and controls were vaccinated. The results may therefore not be representative of the long-term effects. However, the data argue for performing RCTs of mRNA and adenovirus-vector vaccines head-to-head comparing long-term effects on overall mortality.\n","Content: ['Benn, Christine S', 'Schaltz-Buchholzer, Frederik', 'Nielsen, Sebastian', 'Netea, Mihai G', 'Aaby, Peter']\n","\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: Risk factors of postoperative intensive care unit admission during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multicentre retrospective cohort study.\n","Abstract: BACKGROUND: During the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, intensive care unit (ICU) capacity was scarce. Since surgical patients also require ICU admission, determining which factors lead to an increased risk of postoperative ICU admission is essential. This study aims to determine which factors led to an increased risk of unplanned postoperative ICU admission during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This multicentre retrospective cohort study investigated all patients who underwent surgery between 9 March 2020 and 30 June 2020. The primary endpoint was the number of surgical patients requiring postoperative ICU admission. The secondary endpoint was to determine factors leading to an increased risk of unplanned postoperative ICU admission, calculated by multivariate analysis with odds ratios (OR's) and 95% confidence (CI) intervals. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five (4.6%) of the 4051 included patients required unplanned postoperative ICU admission. COVID-19 positive patients were at an increased risk of being admitted to the ICU compared to COVID-19 negative (OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.06-9.33; p = 0.040) and untested patients (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.32-0.70; p = 0.001). Other predictors were male gender (OR 1.36; 95% CI 1.02-1.82; p = 0.046), body mass index (BMI) (OR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.08; p = 0.001), surgical urgency and surgical discipline. CONCLUSION: A confirmed COVID-19 infection, male gender, elevated BMI, surgical urgency, and surgical discipline were independent factors for an increased risk of unplanned postoperative ICU admission. In the event of similar pandemics, postponing surgery in patients with an increased risk of postoperative ICU admission may be considered.\n","Content: ['de Bock, Ellen', 'Filipe, Mando D', 'Herman, Eline S', 'Pronk, Apollo', 'Boerma, Djamila', 'Heikens, Joost T', 'Verheijen, Paul M', 'Vriens, Menno R', 'Richir, Milan C']\n","\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: Pandemic modelling and model citizens: Governing COVID-19 through predictive models, sovereignty and discipline.\n","Abstract: Pandemic modelling functions as a means of producing evidence of potential events and as an instrument of intervention that Tim Rhodes and colleagues describe as entangling science into social practices, calculations into materializations, abstracts into effects and models into society. This article seeks to show how a model society evinced through mathematical models produces a model not only for society but also for citizens, showing them how to act in a certain model manner that prevents an anticipated pandemic future. To this end, we analyse political speeches by various Norwegian ministers to elucidate how various model-based COVID-19 responses enact a 'model citizen'. Theoretically, we combine Rhodes et al.'s arguments with Foucault's concepts of law, discipline and security, thus showing what a model society might imply for the model citizen. Finally, we conclude that although the model society is largely informed by epidemiological models and liberal biopolitics that typically place responsibility on individual subjects, sovereign state power remains manifestly present in the speeches' rhetoric.\n","Content: ['Sandset, Tony', 'Villadsen, Kaspar']\n","\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: An Evaluation of Point-of-Care HbA1c, HbA1c Home Kits, and Glucose Management Indicator: Potential Solutions for Telehealth Glycemic Assessments.\n","Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, fewer in-person clinic visits resulted in fewer point-of-care (POC) HbA1c measurements. In this sub-study, we assessed the performance of alternative glycemic measures that can be obtained remotely, such as HbA1c home kits and Glucose Management Indicator (GMI) values from Dexcom Clarity. Home kit HbA1c (n = 99), GMI, (n = 88), and POC HbA1c (n = 32) were collected from youth with T1D (age 9.7 +/- 4.6 years). Bland-Altman analyses and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (rho(c)) were used to characterize the agreement between paired HbA1c measures. Both the HbA1c home kit and GMI showed a slight positive bias (mean difference 0.18% and 0.34%, respectively) and strong concordance with POC HbA1c (rho(c) = 0.982 [0.965, 0.991] and 0.823 [0.686, 0.904], respectively). GMI showed a slight positive bias (mean difference 0.28%) and fair concordance (rho(c) = 0.750 [0.658, 0.820]) to the HbA1c home kit. In conclusion, the strong concordance of GMI and home kits to POC A1c measures suggest their utility in telehealth visits assessments. Although these are not candidates for replacement, these measures can facilitate telehealth visits, particularly in the context of other POC HbA1c measurements from an individual.\n","Content: ['Zaharieva, Dessi P', 'Addala, Ananta', 'Prahalad, Priya', 'Leverenz, Brianna', 'Arrizon-Ruiz, Nora', 'Ding, Victoria Y', 'Desai, Manisha', 'Karger, Amy B', 'Maahs, David M']\n","\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"]}],"source":["# Loop through each record and print the abstract and content\n","for record in records:\n","    print(\"Title:\", record.get(\"TI\", \"?\"))\n","    print(\"Abstract:\", record.get(\"AB\" , \"?\"))\n","    print(\"Content:\", record.get(\"FAU\" , \"?\")) \n","    print(\"\")\n","    print(\"-\"*100)"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9cg7QHX1npu5"},"source":["## Query Biomedical Journal Citations in the PubMed Database"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ijNhvXfBR6ls"},"outputs":[],"source":["import json \n","import urllib.request \n","import  time "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"gLnfyEE37pyk"},"outputs":[],"source":["import urllib.request\n","import json\n","import time\n","\n","class e_utility(BaseModel):\n","\n","    base_url_esearch = \"https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?\"\n","    base_url_efetch = \"https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?\"\n","    max_retry = 5\n","    sleep_time = 0.2\n","\n","    def search(self, query):\n","        url = self.base_url_esearch + \"db=pubmed&term=\" + query + \"&retmode=json&retmax=10&usehistory=y\"\n","        result = urllib.request.urlopen(url)\n","        text = result.read().decode(\"utf-8\")\n","        json_text = json.loads(text)\n","\n","        articles = []\n","        webenv = json_text[\"esearchresult\"][\"webenv\"]\n","        print(json_text[\"esearchresult\"][\"idlist\"])\n","        for uid in json_text[\"esearchresult\"][\"idlist\"]:\n","            article = self.retrieve_article(uid, webenv)\n","            articles.append(article)\n","        \n","\n","        return json.dumps(articles)\n","\n","    def retrieve_article(self, uid, webenv):\n","        url = self.base_url_efetch + \"db=pubmed&retmode=xml&id=\" + uid + \"&webenv=\" + webenv\n","\n","        retry = 0\n","        while True:\n","            try:\n","                result = urllib.request.urlopen(url)\n","                break\n","            except urllib.error.HTTPError as e:\n","                if e.code == 429 and retry < self.max_retry:\n","                    # Too Many Requests error, wait for an exponentially increasing amount of time\n","                    print(f\"Too Many Requests, waiting for {self.sleep_time:.2f} seconds...\")\n","                    time.sleep(self.sleep_time)\n","                    self.sleep_time *= 2\n","                    retry += 1\n","                else:\n","                    raise e\n","\n","        xml_text = result.read().decode(\"utf-8\")\n","\n","        # Get title\n","        title = ''\n","        if '<ArticleTitle>' in xml_text and '</ArticleTitle>' in xml_text:\n","            start_tag = '<ArticleTitle>'\n","            end_tag = '</ArticleTitle>'\n","            title = xml_text[xml_text.index(start_tag)+len(start_tag):xml_text.index(end_tag)]\n","\n","        # Get abstract\n","        abstract = ''\n","        if '<AbstractText>' in xml_text and '</AbstractText>' in xml_text:\n","            start_tag = '<AbstractText>'\n","            end_tag = '</AbstractText>'\n","            abstract = xml_text[xml_text.index(start_tag)+len(start_tag):xml_text.index(end_tag)]\n","\n","        # Return article as dictionary\n","        article = {'uid': uid, 'title': title, 'abstract': abstract}\n","        return article\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5468,"status":"ok","timestamp":1683975488533,"user":{"displayName":"Younis Bashir","userId":"06409139472792339415"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"UHUMVfQTsICL","outputId":"33d7ad77-9ca5-41ec-81d5-51ea04686dbd"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["['37172383', '37172362', '37172333', '37172326', '37172319', '37172309', '37172274', '37172190', '37172174', '37172159']\n","Too Many Requests, waiting for 0.20 seconds...\n","Too Many Requests, waiting for 0.40 seconds...\n","Too Many Requests, waiting for 0.80 seconds...\n","Too Many Requests, waiting for 1.60 seconds...\n","Title: Antibiotic resistomes in face-mask biofilm along an urban river: Multiple drivers and co-occurrence with human opportunistic pathogens.\n","Abstract: Discarded face masks from the global COVID-19 pandemic have contributed significantly to plastic pollution in surface water, whereas their potential as a reservoir for aquatic pollutants is not well understood. Herein, we conducted a field experiment along a human-impacted urban river, investigating the variations of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), pathogens, and water-borne contaminants in commonly-used face masks. Results showed that high-biomass biofilms formed on face masks selectively enriched more ARGs than stone biofilm (0.08-0.22 vs 0.07-0.15 copies/16&#xa0;S rRNA gene copies) from bulk water, which mainly due to unique microbial communities, enhanced horizontal gene transfer, and selective pressure of accumulated contaminants based on redundancy analysis and variation partitioning analysis. Several human opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Acinetobacter, Escherichia-Shigella, Bacillus, and Klebsiella), which are considered potential ARG carriers, were also greatly concentrated in face-mask biofilms, imposing a potential threat to aquatic ecological environment and human health. Moreover, wastewater treatment plant effluents, as an important source of pollutants to urban rivers, further aggravated the abundances of ARGs and opportunistic pathogens in face-mask biofilms. Our findings demonstrated that discarded face masks provide a hotspot for the proliferation and spread of ARGs and pathogens in urban water, highlighting the urgent requirement for implementing stricter regulations in face mask disposal.\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: Size-classified monitoring of ATP bioluminescence for rapid assessment of biological distribution in airborne particulates.\n","Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic ignited massive research into the rapid detection of bioaerosols. In particular, nanotechnology-based detection strategies are proposed as alternatives because of issues in bioaerosol enrichment and lead time for molecular diagnostics; however, the practical implementation of such techniques is still unclear due to obstacles regarding the large research and development effort and investment for the validation. The use of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence (expressed as relative luminescence unit (RLU) per unit volume of air) of airborne particulate matter (PM) to determine the bacterial population as a representative of the total bioaerosols (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) has been raised frequently because of the high reponse speed, resolution, and compatibility with culture-based bioaerosol monitoring. On the other hand, additional engineering attempts are required to confer significance because of the size-classified (bioluminescence for different PM sizes) and specific (bioluminescence per unit PM mass) biological risks of air for providing proper interventions in the case of airborne transmission. In this study, disc-type impactors to cut-off aerosols larger than 1&#xa0;&#x3bc;m, 2.5 &#x3bc;m, and 10&#xa0;&#x3bc;m were designed and constructed to collect PM1, PM2.5, and PM10 on sampling swabs. This engineering enabled reliable size-classified bioluminescence signals using a commercial ATP luminometer after just 5 min of air intake. The simultaneous operations of a six-stage Andersen impactor and optical PM spectrometers were conducted to determine the correlations between the resulting RLU and colony forming unit (CFU; from the Andersen impactor) or PM mass concentration (deriving specific bioluminescence).\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","Title: Fibrinolytic system and COVID-19: From an innovative view of epithelial ion transport.\n","Abstract: Lifeways of worldwide people have changed dramatically amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and public health is at stake currently. In the early stage of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, fibrinolytic system is mostly inhibited, which is responsible for the development of hypofibrinolysis, promoting disseminated intravascular coagulation, hyaline membrane formation, and pulmonary edema. Whereas the common feature and risk factor at advanced stage is a large amount of fibrin degradation products, including D-dimer, the characteristic of hyperfibrinolysis. Plasmin can cleave both SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and &#x3b3; subunit of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), a critical element to edematous fluid clearance. In this review, we aim to sort out the role of fibrinolytic system in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, as well as provide the possible guidance in current treating methods. In addition, the abnormal regulation of ENaC in the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 mediated hypofibrinolysis and hyperfibrinolysis are summarized, with the view of proposing an innovative view of epithelial ion transport in preventing the dysfunction of fibrinolytic system during the progress of COVID-19.\n","----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"]}],"source":["\n","e = e_utility()\n","json_str = e.search(\"COVID-19\")\n","articles = json.loads(json_str)\n","\n","for article in articles[:3]:\n","    print(\"Title: \" + article['title'])\n","    print(\"Abstract: \" + article['abstract'])\n","    print(\"-\"*100)\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"toeumAlQN7sH"},"source":["## Implemnt custom tool on langchin pubmed search  using Bio package"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":444,"status":"ok","timestamp":1684006397557,"user":{"displayName":"Younis Bashir","userId":"06409139472792339415"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"SSTpI9fo2a2y"},"outputs":[],"source":["import logging\n","from typing import Any, Dict, List\n","\n","from Bio import Entrez\n","from pydantic import BaseModel, Extra, root_validator\n","import requests\n","from io import StringIO , BytesIO\n","\n","from langchain.schema import Document\n","\n","logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":71,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":330,"status":"ok","timestamp":1684008949122,"user":{"displayName":"Younis Bashir","userId":"06409139472792339415"},"user_tz":-180},"id":"MH4fWZxs1vhn"},"outputs":[],"source":["class PubMedAPIWrapper(BaseModel):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Wrapper around PubMed API.\n","\n","    This wrapper will use the PubMed API to conduct searches and fetch\n","    document summaries.

This study analyzed the causes of the haze process of COVID-19, the diurnal variation characteristics of air pollutants, and the distribution characteristics of air pollutants at different stages of haze.The results showed that Zhengzhou was mainly controlled by the high-pressure ridge during the haze process, and the weather situation was stable, which was conducive to the accumulation of air pollutants. SNA was the main component of water-soluble ions, accounting for more than 90%. Home isolation measures during COVID-19 had different impacts on the distribution characteristics of air pollutants in different haze stages. After COVID-19, the concentration of PM(2.5) in the clean, occurrence, and dissipation stages increased compared with that before COVID-19 but significantly decreased in the development stage. The home isolation policy significantly reduced the high value of PM(2.5). The concentrations of NO(2), SO(2), NH(3), and CO were the highest in the haze development stage, showing a trend of first increasing and then decreasing. The concentration of O(3) was lowest in the pre-COVID-19 development stage but highest in the post-COVID-19 development stage. The linear correlation between[NH(4)(+)]/[SO(4)(2-)] and[NO(3)(-)]/[SO(4)(2-)] at different time periods before and after COVID-19 was strong, indicating that the home isolation policy of COVID-19 did not change the generation mode of NO(3)(-), and the corresponding reaction was always the main generation mode of NO(3)(\u001b[0m\n","Thought:"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING:langchain.chat_models.openai:Retrying langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.completion_with_retry.<locals>._completion_with_retry in 2.0 seconds as it raised RateLimitError: Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-dydteKigIX65XSDc1J1PlDG6 on requests per min.

During prenatal and early postnatal development, neural stem cells (NSCs) differentiate into neurons and migrate to appropriate areas such as the olfactory bulb where they integrate into existing neural networks; these phenomena constitute the multistep process of neurogenesis. Alterations in any of these processes impair neurogenesis and may even lead to brain dysfunction, including cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Here, we first summarize the main properties of mammalian neurogenic niches to describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurogenesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that neurogenesis plays an integral role in neuronal plasticity in the brain and cognition in the postnatal period. Given that neurogenesis can be highly modulated by a number of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, we discuss the impact of extrinsic (e.g., alcohol) and intrinsic (e.g., hormones) modulators on neurogenesis. Additionally, we provide an overview of the contribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to persistent neurological sequelae such as neurodegeneration, neurogenic defects and accelerated neuronal cell death. Together, our review provides a link between extrinsic/intrinsic factors and neurogenesis and explains the possible mechanisms of abnormal neurogenesis underlying neurological disorders.\n","\n","Published: 2023 Apr 25\n","Title: Overview of Activities in the Field of Occupational Health and Safety during the COVID-19 Period Taken by Polish SMEs.\n","Summary: The safety of work, employees, and clients of micro, small, and medium-sized enterpr\u001b[0m\n","Thought:"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING:langchain.chat_models.openai:Retrying langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.completion_with_retry.<locals>._completion_with_retry in 2.0 seconds as it raised RateLimitError: Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-dydteKigIX65XSDc1J1PlDG6 on requests per min.

As expected, the number of mRNA vaccines in preclinical and clinical development increased exponentially since 2020, including numerous improvements in mRNA formulation design, delivery methods and manufacturing processes. However, the technology faces challenges such as the cost of raw materials, the lack of standardization, and delivery optimization. MRNA technology may provide a solution to some of the emerging infectious diseases as well as the deadliest hard-to-treat infectious diseases malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), for which an effective vaccine, easily deployable to endemic areas is urgently needed. In this review, we discuss the functional structure, design, manufacturing processes and delivery methods of mRNA vaccines. We provide an up-to-date overview of the preclinical and clinical development of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases, and discuss the immunogenicity, efficacy and correlates of protection of mRNA vaccines, with particular focus on research and development of mRNA vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.\n","\n","Published: 2023 May 12\n","Title: Multimodality Cardiac Imaging in COVID.\n","Summary: Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, is associated with numerous potential secondary complications.

During prenatal and early postnatal development, neural stem cells (NSCs) differentiate into neurons and migrate to appropriate areas such as the olfactory bulb where they integrate into existing neural networks; these phenomena constitute the multistep process of neurogenesis. Alterations in any of these processes impair neurogenesis and may even lead to brain dysfunction, including cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration. Here, we first summarize the main properties of mammalian neurogenic niches to describe the cellular and molecular mechanisms of neurogenesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that neurogenesis plays an integral role in neuronal plasticity in the brain and cognition in the postnatal period. Given that neurogenesis can be highly modulated by a number of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, we discuss the impact of extrinsic (e.g., alcohol) and intrinsic (e.g., hormones) modulators on neurogenesis. Additionally, we provide an overview of the contribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection to persistent neurological sequelae such as neurodegeneration, neurogenic defects and accelerated neuronal cell death. Together, our review provides a link between extrinsic/intrinsic factors and neurogenesis and explains the possible mechanisms of abnormal neurogenesis underlying neurological disorders.\n","\n","Published: <Year>2023</Year><Month>Apr</Month><Day>25</Day>\n","Title: Overview of Activities in the Field of Occupational Health and Safety during the COVID-19 Period Taken by Polish SMEs.\n","Summary: The safety\u001b[0m\n","Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mI need to refine my search query again to find a more relevant article.\n","Action: PubMed\n","Action Input: \"COVID-19 overview virus\"\u001b[0m['37168860', '37167354', '37160482']\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING:langchain.chat_models.openai:Retrying langchain.chat_models.openai.ChatOpenAI.completion_with_retry.<locals>._completion_with_retry in 1.0 seconds as it raised RateLimitError: Rate limit reached for default-gpt-3.5-turbo in organization org-dydteKigIX65XSDc1J1PlDG6 on requests per min.

As expected, the number of mRNA vaccines in preclinical and clinical development increased exponentially since 2020, including numerous improvements in mRNA formulation design, delivery methods and manufacturing processes. However, the technology faces challenges such as the cost of raw materials, the lack of standardization, and delivery optimization. MRNA technology may provide a solution to some of the emerging infectious diseases as well as the deadliest hard-to-treat infectious diseases malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), for which an effective vaccine, easily deployable to endemic areas is urgently needed. In this review, we discuss the functional structure, design, manufacturing processes and delivery methods of mRNA vaccines. We provide an up-to-date overview of the preclinical and clinical development of mRNA vaccines against infectious diseases, and discuss the immunogenicity, efficacy and correlates of protection of mRNA vaccines, with particular focus on research and development of mRNA vaccines against malaria, tuberculosis and HIV.\n","\n","Published: <Year>2023</Year><Month>May</Month><Day>12</Day>\n","Title: Multimodality Cardiac Imaging in COVID.\n","Summary: Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID, is associated with numerous potential secondary complications.
